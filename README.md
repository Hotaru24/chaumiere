# La Chaumi√®re

The La Chaumiere website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

The style is built with the library [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Minimal Node.js version 18.13.0
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)
