  aboutdescription: >
    I am Belgian and I fell in love with the Périgord 30 years ago, date of my first vacations in the region. 
    Since this time, I dreamed of one day being able to welcome guests in the Dordogne. 
    A very radical change of life which was not made without difficulties. 
    For the last five years, I have been living in the Périgord and I try to share this passion with my guests, to advise them on a visit, a good wine or a restaurant. 
    It's an opportunity to make beautiful, rich and warm encounters.
    If you come to visit us, you will certainly have the opportunity to meet Marie, my partner.
    We hope to welcome you very soon to share our passion and help you have a wonderful and warm stay !
    Marie and Thierry
