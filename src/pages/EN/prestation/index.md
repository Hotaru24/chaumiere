    Upon reservation and according to our availability, we organize a table d'hôte. 
    One of the great assets of the Périgord is of course its gastronomical wealth. 
    We will advise you on nearby restaurants, but we also organize on request a 4-course dinner (starter, main course, cheese and dessert) which will allow you to discover the jewels of Périgord cuisine: foie gras, truffles (a great specialty of Sainte-Alvère), duck in all its variations (magrets, aiguillettes, parmentier et cuisse confites).
    Every morning we offer a complete and generous breakfast. 
    Bread, pastries, charcuterie, cheese, freshly squeezed fruit juices, fruit and eggs prepared according to your wishes are on the menu. 
    Price: 50€/person wine included

  heading: Sainte-Alvère in the heart of Périgord
  description: >
    The heritage of the Dordogne is extremely rich, and there is something for everyone. 
    You can travel back in time and discover world famous prehistoric sites and beautiful testimonies of the Middle Ages. 
    Saint-Alvère, which is precisely at the intersection of the green, purple and black Périgord, is an ideal starting point to discover them.
